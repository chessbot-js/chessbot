It's a bot for Chess.com. It realised as Google Chrome extension and can be used 
with any chrome-like browsers to win against your opponent.

**I removed this extension from the Google Chrome catalog cause now I dont have time to work on it. Thanks for all time you spend with it!**

Link to Chrome Store: **removed**
